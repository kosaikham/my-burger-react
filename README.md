## Project Description

A simple small burger app written in react + redux.
As I learned React 16 from Udemy, Youtube and online blogs, I got a lot new things by building this project and following the instructors' lectures at the same time. I keep notes and some tricks while I built the project. This small project covers the following topics:
- some useful ES6 syntax and knowledge
- Styling React Components and elements
- Debugging
- Unit Testing ( a bit )
- Deep Diving into React Components and lifecycle hooks
- Fetching external resources
- Routing
- Form Validation ( a bit )
- redux ( basic, advanced, async Fetching etc)
- Authentication
- Performance ( like lazy loading , pureComponent )
- Deployment
